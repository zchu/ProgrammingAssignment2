## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## 
##The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
##set the value of the matrix
##get the value of the matrix
##set the value of the inverse
##get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y){
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "vector" created with the above function.
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
    
}
